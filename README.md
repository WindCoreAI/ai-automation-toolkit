### Common AI Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not editing AI output.** Always review and add your voice. Clients can smell unedited AI.
2. **Generic prompts → generic outputs.** The more context you give, the better the output.
3. **One-shot prompting.** Iterate — "make it shorter," "more conversational," "add a specific example."
4. **Ignoring AI hallucinations.** Always fact-check claims, stats, and links.
5. **Not saving good prompts.** When a prompt works well, save the customized version.
6. **Using the wrong model.** Claude for long-form analysis, ChatGPT for quick tasks, Perplexity for research.
7. **Over-automating client-facing work.** AI drafts, you finalize. Clients pay for your judgment.
8. **Paying for tools you don't use.** Audit your subscriptions quarterly. Free tiers are often enough.

### Monthly AI ROI Tracker

Copy this template and fill it in monthly:

| Month | AI Tool Spend | Hours Saved | Your Hourly Rate | Value of Time Saved | Net ROI | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------|-------|
| {MONTH_1} | ${AMOUNT} | {HOURS}h | ${RATE}/h | ${HOURS × RATE} | ${VALUE - SPEND} | {WHAT_WORKED_BEST} |
| {MONTH_2} | ${AMOUNT} | {HOURS}h | ${RATE}/h | ${HOURS × RATE} | ${VALUE - SPEND} | {WHAT_WORKED_BEST} |
| {MONTH_3} | ${AMOUNT} | {HOURS}h | ${RATE}/h | ${HOURS × RATE} | ${VALUE - SPEND} | {WHAT_WORKED_BEST} |
| **Q Total** | **${SUM}** | **{SUM}h** | — | **${SUM}** | **${SUM}** | |

**How to track hours saved:** When you use an AI template, note how long it took vs. how long it used to take manually. Common benchmarks: email sequences (save 2-3h), proposals (save 1h), content repurposing (save 2-4h/week).
