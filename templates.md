### Common AI Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not editing AI output.** Always review and add your voice.
2. **Generic prompts → generic outputs.** Be specific with context.
3. **Skipping the "act as" framing.** Tell AI who to be.
4. **One-shot prompting.** Iterate — first draft is a starting point.
5. **Ignoring AI hallucinations.** Always fact-check claims and stats.
6. **Not saving good prompts.** Build a prompt library (like this toolkit!).
7. **Over-relying on one tool.** Different AI tools have different strengths.
8. **Forgetting the human touch.** AI is the assistant, you're the author.
